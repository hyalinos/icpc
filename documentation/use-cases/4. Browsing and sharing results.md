## 4. Browsing and sharing results

You can always look at all collected types by openning `Hyalinos -> View results`.

If you want to contribute to Mycelium with types for your libraries you can:

- Erase local mycelium cache (to not submit types already in the system). To do this execute in the Playground: `Mycelium erase`
- Run inference for the packages from your libraries as it described in the [first use-case](https://github.com/hyalinos/icpc/blob/main/documentation/use-cases/1.%20Running%20inference%20on%20selected%20packages.md)
. You can choose the best matching merging strategy and tune the confidence scores and levels that better reflects the matter of your code-base.

- Open `Hyalinos` and click on `Save results`. Hyalinos will save your results in the `%image_folder/data/mycelium.json%. Now you can create a pull request to Mycelium sending us your library.

Note: if you want to experiment further with the pre-collected types, execute in the Playground:
```
Mycelium initialize.
Mycelium exportFromDisk.
Mycelium update
```
That will restore the local cache.
