## 3. Type hints and type checking

- Open Playground (Browse -> Playground)
- Type `'hello' isString`.

`TypeInferenceStore` controller will search for the receiver and method type in the storage and shows the result `ByteString(String)>>isString->Boolean(1.0)`.
It means that the method `isString` has been called on the receiver of the type `ByteString` but the method is defined in the type `String`. 
Storage contains type for method `isString` defined for the superclass of a `String` and inferred with the 100% confidence (and so it is displayed in green).

- Type `OrderedCollection new`. It will yeld the type OrderedColletction, the one that we have added manually based on the domain knowledge.

- Type `(OrderedCollection new add: 'hello' isString) asStrin`. For resolving this case we have a special notation - we set the return type for the method `add` called on the receiver of the `OrderedCollection` (as we see in the previous example)  as `t1`, meaning that the return type of `add:` corresponds to the return type of its first argument, in this case `'hello' isString` which is `Boolean` (as we saw in the first example).

So the receiver (OrderedCollection new add: 'hello' isString) has type `Boolean` and the method `asString` defined for a supertype of `Boolean` as `String`. However the confidence is lower as it results from merging types participated in the evaluation of a receiver.
