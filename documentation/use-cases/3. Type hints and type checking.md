## 3. Type hints and type checking

- Open Playground (Browse -> Playground)
- Type `'hello' isString`.

TypeInferenceStore controller will search for the receiver and method type in the storage and shows the result `ByteString(String)>>isString->Boolean(1.0)`.
It means that the method `isString` has been called on the receiver of the type `ByteString` but the method is defined in the type `String`. 
Storage contains type for method `isString` defined for the superclass of a `String` and inferred with the 100% confidence (and so it is displayed in green).
